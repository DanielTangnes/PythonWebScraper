# PythonWebScraper
Python web scraper that checks price, and sends you an email if the price is under a certain value.

The web scaper uses google's smtp servers to send an email whenever the price drops below a certain value.

You need one email address to send from, and one to recieve.
You can easily setup an app password for gmail on the email address you want to send from, or you could just use your regular login password.
